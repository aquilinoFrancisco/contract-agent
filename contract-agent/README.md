# Contract Agent

An AI-powered legal contract analysis tool built as a portfolio project to demonstrate modern AI Agent architecture.

## What It Does

Upload a PDF or TXT contract and receive a structured analysis in seconds:

- **Executive Summary** — plain-language overview of the contract
- **Important Clauses** — key provisions extracted and explained
- **Potential Risks & Red Flags** — unusual or dangerous terms highlighted
- **Obligations** — what each party must do
- **Key Dates** — deadlines, renewal windows, termination notices

## Architecture

```
Streamlit UI (app/)
    │
    ▼
LangGraph Workflow (graph/)        ← orchestrates the pipeline
    │
    ├── ContractReader Agent   ──┐
    ├── LegalAnalyst Agent     ──┤  CrewAI (crew/)
    └── ExecutiveSummarizer    ──┘
              │
              ▼
        MCP Tools (mcp/)           ← read_file · search_clause · save_report
              │
    ┌─────────┴──────────┐
contracts/ (input)    reports/ (output)
```

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| LangGraph as orchestrator | Provides explicit, inspectable state + conditional edges — not a black box |
| CrewAI for agents | Role-based agents with clear separation of concerns (reader → analyst → summarizer) |
| MCP for tools | Decouples tool implementation from agent logic; MCP is the emerging standard |
| Streamlit as UI | Zero-friction UI for data-heavy AI apps; keeps the demo self-contained |
| `pyproject.toml` | Modern Python packaging standard (PEP 621); replaces legacy `requirements.txt` |
